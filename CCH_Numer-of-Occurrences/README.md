# Nummer of Occurences
### Write a program to find the number of occurences of each letter, irrespective of their case and print them in alphabetical order.
### Rules
- Cannot use built-in functions. (such as Arrays.sort, Collection.contains() Collection.find() etc.)
- Must ignore non-alphabetic characters.
- Occurence findings should not be case sensitive.
### Example
For example, all the occurences for the input String "Red Race Car" would be:

if the input string contains any non-alphabetic characters, the application will ignore them.
